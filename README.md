# Flam-Interactive-Bezier-Curve
This project creates an interactive cubic Bézier curve resembling a spring rope.
The curve responds to the movement of the mouse cursor, plots the vector along the tangent lines to the curve, and updates at a rate of about 60 frames per second.

All math and physics are fully implemented manually without accessing any existing Bézier and animation APIs of the class.
